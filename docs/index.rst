Welcome to interrogatio's documentation!
========================================


A python library to prompt users for inputs in a terminal application.


What is interrogatio
********************

interrogatio is a python 3.8+ library based on the `python-prompt-toolkit
<https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit>`_ and inspired by `PyInquirer
<https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer/>`_ that help CLI developers to ask users for inputs.


Questions can be rendered onto the terminal prompt or as curses-like dialogs.
